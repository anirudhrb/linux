	  Provides access to interfaces for managing guest virtual machines
	  running under the Microsoft Hypervisor.

	  These interfaces will only work when Linux is running as root
	  partition on the Microsoft Hypervisor.

	  The interfaces are provided via a device named /dev/mshv.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here.
          The module is named mshv.

	  If unsure, say N.
